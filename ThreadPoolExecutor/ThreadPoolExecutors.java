/**
 * 线程池解决了两个问题：
 * · 执行大量的异步任务时的性能改进，避免的过多线程调度的额外开销
 * · 提供了绑定和管理资源的方法
 * 
 * 为了使线程池具有强大的适用性，这里提供了多个可调节的参数。为了方便使用
 * 通常可以使用Executors工具类的方法：
 * · newCacheThreadPool 无界的线程池，自带线程回收
 * · newFixedThreadPool 固定大小的线程池
 * · newSingleThreadExecutor 单个后台线程
 * 这三个方法足以应付多数使用场景，当然你可以选择自定义线程池的参数，参数
 * 设置参考如下：
 * 1.core和max池大小：
 * 线程池会根据指定的corePoolSize和maximumPoolSize设置的范围自动的调整
 * 线程池中线程数。
 * 当在方法execute中提交新任务时，如果此时池内的线程数未达到corePoolSize，
 * 即使有其他空闲状态的线程，也会新创建一个线程来执行任务；如果此时池内线程数已经达到corePoolSize,
 * 并且只有当任务队列满了的时候，才会新创建一个线程执行任务。
 * 可以使用setCorePoolSize和SetMaximumPoolSize动态的修改池的大小
 * 
 * 2.按需构造：
 * 线程池中在一开始时没有线程，只有当新任务到底时才创建线程。为了满足某种需求，例如：用一个非空的
 * 任务队列构造一个线程池时，可能希望线程池初始化时就创建好线程。你可以使用prestartCoreThread和
 * prestartAllCoreThreads方法来预先启动核心线程
 * 
 * 3.创建新线程
 * 新线程的创建是由ThreadFactory完成，如果没有另外的指定，则使用E​​xecutors.defaultThreadFactory(),
 * 它创建的线程都属于同一个线程组，并且具有同样的优先级。
 * 当然你可以提供不同的ThreadFactory，就可以自定义线程的名称、所属线程组、优先级、守护线程等状态。
 * 如果自定义的ThreadFactory的newThread()返回null，程序将继续执行，但是不会创建线程执行任务。
 * newThread()的线程必须是可变的，也就是池对它有修改的权限
 * 
 * 4.存活时间
 * keepAliveTime是为了约束超过corePoolSize那一部分的线程，也就是说，如果池中的线程数如果目前超过corePoolSize
 * 那么，当没有可执行的任务时候，这一部分的线程或在过了keepAliveTime之后被销毁。这样做是为了减少资源消耗，
 * 可以使用setKeepAliveTime(long,TimeUnit)方法修改这个参数
 * allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)这个方法可以将keepAliveTime策略用于核心线程
 * 
 * 5.队列
 * 任何的BlockingQueue(阻塞队列)都可以用于传输和保存提交的任务，注意：
 * · 如果当前线程数小于corePoolSize，则线程池更倾向于创建新线程来执行任务
 * · 如果当前线程数多于corePoolSize，则线程池更倾向于将任务加入队列
 * · 如果队列满了，则会创建一个新的线程来执行任务。
 * · 当队列满了，线程数为maximumPoolSize，此时无法接受新任务，会触发拒绝策略
 * 排队的一般策略有以下三种：
 * 1. 直接交付：这需要使maximumPoolSize是无限大，因为如果新任务到来时，池中线程数已经达到了corePoolSize，并且没有空闲
 * 的核心线程来执行它，新任务会尝试入队，但是入队会失败，这将导致新创建一个线程去运行它。这是默认的一个很好的选择
 * 2.
 * 无限队列（链队列）：LinkedBlockingQueue，这种方式将会导致maximumPoolSize参数无效，线程池中最大线程数为corePoolSize
 * 当没有线程可执行新任务时将会将新任务放入队列中。这种方式适用于各任务彼此之间不会相互影响。但是如果新任务爆发式的到来，
 * 这会导致任务的响应时间过长。（因为队列是无界的，因此不会触发拒绝策略）
 * 3. 有限队列（数组队列）：ArrayBlockingQueue，这种方式有助于防止资源耗尽，但这有可能降低吞吐量。
 * 大队列小池：可以有效降低CPU利用率、OS资源上下文切换。但会导致人为的吞吐量降低。如果任务是频繁的引起阻塞的（例如IO），
 * 这会导致系统花费更多的时间在线程调度上。
 * 小队列大池：可以有效发挥CPU利用率，但是队列较小，如果新任务过多，会导致频繁的拒绝策略的执行，也会降低吞吐量。
 * 6.拒绝任务
 * 当线程池已被终止或队列已满并且线程池内线程达到最大界限，这时调用execute方法新任务将不能被执行，
 * 这时会调用RejectedExecutionHandler 的
 * RejectedExecutionHandler.rejectedExecution(Runnable, ThreadPoolExecutor) 方法
 * 提供拒绝策略有四种：
 * 1. AbortPolicy：抛出运行时异常RejectedExecutionException
 * 2. CallerRunsPolicy：交给调用execute方法的线程执行任务。这种简单的反馈控制机制，可以减慢提交新任务的速度
 * 3. DiscardPolicy：直接丢弃任务，这种情况使用较少
 * 4. DiscardOldestPolicy: 如果线程池没有被关闭，则将队列头部任务丢弃，将现在的新任务加入并执行
 * 需要注意的是，使用不同的类型的队列应该使用不同的拒绝策略
 * 
 * 7.钩子方法
 * 这个类提供了可以重写的两个方法：beforeExecute(Thread,Runnable)和afterExecute(Runnable,Throwable)
 * 这两个方法会在每个任务之前和之后执行，这些可以用于操纵执行的环境。
 * 另外可以重写terminated方法以执行线程池完全终止后需要完成的的任何特殊处理。
 * 注意如果这几个回调方法中出现了异常，那么内部的任务可能会依次终止、突然终止或者可能被取代
 * 
 * 8.线程维护
 * 可以使用getQueue方法获取阻塞队列，但不要获取这个队列做其他事情，当遇到大量的任务被取消时，可以使用remove和purge方法协助存储回收

    /**
     * The main pool control state, ctl, is an atomic integer packing
     * two conceptual fields
     * workerCount, indicating the effective number of threads
     * runState, indicating whether running, shutting down etc
     *
     * In order to pack them into one int, we limit workerCount to
     * (2^29)-1 (about 500 million) threads rather than (2^31)-1 (2
     * billion) otherwise representable. If this is ever an issue in
     * the future, the variable can be changed to be an AtomicLong,
     * and the shift/mask constants below adjusted. But until the need
     * arises, this code is a bit faster and simpler using an int.
     *
     * The workerCount is the number of workers that have been
     * permitted to start and not permitted to stop. The value may be
     * transiently different from the actual number of live threads,
     * for example when a ThreadFactory fails to create a thread when
     * asked, and when exiting threads are still performing
     * bookkeeping before terminating. The user-visible pool size is
     * reported as the current size of the workers set.
     *
     * The runState provides the main lifecycle control, taking on values:
     *
     * RUNNING: Accept new tasks and process queued tasks
     * SHUTDOWN: Don't accept new tasks, but process queued tasks
     * STOP: Don't accept new tasks, don't process queued tasks,
     * and interrupt in-progress tasks
     * TIDYING: All tasks have terminated, workerCount is zero,
     * the thread transitioning to state TIDYING
     * will run the terminated() hook method
     * TERMINATED: terminated() has completed
     *
     * The numerical order among these values matters, to allow
     * ordered comparisons. The runState monotonically increases over
     * time, but need not hit each state. The transitions are:
     *
     * RUNNING -> SHUTDOWN
     * On invocation of shutdown()
     * (RUNNING or SHUTDOWN) -> STOP
     * On invocation of shutdownNow()
     * SHUTDOWN -> TIDYING
     * When both queue and pool are empty
     * STOP -> TIDYING
     * When pool is empty
     * TIDYING -> TERMINATED
     * When the terminated() hook method has completed
     *
     * Threads waiting in awaitTermination() will return when the
     * state reaches TERMINATED.
     *
     * Detecting the transition from SHUTDOWN to TIDYING is less
     * straightforward than you'd like because the queue may become
     * empty after non-empty and vice versa during SHUTDOWN state, but
     * we can only terminate if, after seeing that it is empty, we see
     * that workerCount is 0 (which sometimes entails a recheck -- see

     * running, we get tasks from getTask. If it returns null then the
     * worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration
     * parameters. Other exits result from exception throws in
     * external code, in which case completedAbruptly holds, which
     * usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread.
     *
     * 2. Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent
     * other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and then we
     * ensure that unless pool is stopping, this thread does not have
     * its interrupt set.
     *
     * 3. Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute, which
     * might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die
     * (breaking loop with completedAbruptly true) without processing
     * the task.
     *
     * 4. Assuming beforeExecute completes normally, we run the task,
     * gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterExecute.
     * We separately handle RuntimeException, Error (both of which the
     * specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary Throwables.
     * Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within Runnable.run, we
     * wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the thread's
     * UncaughtExceptionHandler). Any thrown exception also
     * conservatively causes thread to die.
     *
     * 5. After task.run completes, we call afterExecute, which may
     * also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to
     * die. According to JLS Sec 14.20, this exception is the one that
     * will be in effect even if task.run throws.
     *
     * The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute
     * and the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate
     * information as we can provide about any problems encountered by
     * user code.
